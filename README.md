# AWS S3 Bucket Static Website Deployment using Terraform

This Terraform project provisions an S3 bucket, configures it for static website hosting, and uploads necessary files to the bucket. The bucket is made publicly accessible, and ACLs are set accordingly.

## Project Overview

This project sets up an AWS S3 bucket to host a static website. The website consists of an `index.html`, `error.html`, and `profile.png` file, all of which are uploaded to the bucket. The bucket is configured with public access, ownership controls, and a custom ACL that allows public read access.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 1.9.3 or later
- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create S3 buckets and configure them.

## Terraform Files

### `main.tf`

This file contains the primary Terraform configuration that provisions the S3 bucket, sets up the website configuration, and uploads the required files.

```hcl
# S3 bucket creation
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mybucket" {
  bucket = var.bucketname 
}

# Ownership controls for the bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  rule {
    object_ownership = "BucketOwnerPreferred"
  }
}

# Public access settings for the bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}

# ACL configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  depends_on = [
    aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.example,
    aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.example,
  ]
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  acl    = "public-read"
}

# Uploading files to the bucket
resource "aws_s3_object" "index" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "index.html"
  acl = "public-read"
  content_type = "text/html"
}

resource "aws_s3_object" "error" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  key    = "error.html"
  source = "error.html"
  acl = "public-read"
  content_type = "text/html"
}

resource "aws_s3_object" "profile" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  key    = "profile.png"
  source = "profile.png"
  acl = "public-read"
}

# S3 bucket website configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration" "website" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id 
  index_document {
    suffix = "index.html"
  }
  error_document {
    key = "error.html"
  }
  depends_on = [ aws_s3_bucket_acl.example ]
}
```

### `provider.tf`

This file configures the AWS provider.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.62.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

### `variable.tf`

This file defines variables used in the configuration.

```hcl
variable "bucketname" {
  default = "myprojectwebapp1182024"
}
```

### `terraform.tfstate`

This file contains the state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform. It includes details about the resources created, such as S3 bucket names, ACLs, and website configurations.

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform

Before applying the configuration, initialize the Terraform workspace.

```bash
terraform init
```

### Apply the Configuration

Apply the configuration to create the resources in your AWS account.

```bash
terraform apply
```

Confirm the apply action when prompted.

### Verify the Deployment

Once the apply is complete, you can verify that the S3 bucket has been created and the website is accessible.

1. **Bucket URL**: Visit the bucket's public URL to view the website.
2. **Website Configuration**: Check the bucket properties in the AWS S3 console to verify the website configuration.

## Resources Created

- **S3 Bucket**: `myprojectwebapp1182024`
- **ACL Configuration**: Public read access
- **Files Uploaded**:
  - `index.html`
  - `error.html`
  - `profile.png`
- **Website Configuration**:
  - `index.html` as the default document
  - `error.html` as the error page
